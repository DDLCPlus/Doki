# Doki
 An experimental DDLC+ modding framework, written in C#.

# GOAL
Eventually, we imagine a future where it'd be as easy to mod Plus as it is to mod the base game. And this is an attempt in getting us closer to that. A write up on how the game works internally is [here](https://arcadia.noia.site/posts/1733492691528), which should clear up some confusion on how this mod works and on how to mod DDLC+'s scripts and assets properly. <br>
# WARNING
This is not 100% complete and is more of a proof of concept. <br> This project is also dedicated to Kizby who passed away in late 2022, she's the one who inspired us to mod Plus way back in July 2021 with her TestDDLCMod.

# CREDITS
Kizby - Unpickler.cs and some .rpa & .rpyc references<br>
Yedrah - Custom background image (In the DokiModTest's asset bundle) <br>
aaartrtrt - RenDisco (Which we have modified slightly to work with DDLC+'s renpy stuff) <br>

# HOW TO SETUP
Download Dokiter from releases (WIP Mod manager & installer) (or build it idk) -> select DDLC Plus .exe while installing and wait for it to say patches were successful (or not) <br>
Build DokiModTest -> create a new folder for it "DokiModTest" -> move DokiModTest.dll into that folder and drag "DokiModTest" into Doki\Mods in the game's directory. <br>
Or find the attached DokiModTest folder in releases & just drag that into your mods folder.
