# Doki
 An experimental DDLC+ modding framework, written in C#.

# GOAL
Eventually, I'd imagine a future where it'd be as easy to mod Plus as it is to mod the base game. And this is an attempt in getting us closer to that. A write up on how the game works internally is coming soon, which should clear up some confusion on how this mod works and on how to mod DDLC+'s scripts and assets properly. <br>
# WARNING
This is not 100% complete and is more of a proof of concept. <br> This project is also dedicated to Kizby who passed away in late 2022, she's the one who inspired me to mod Plus way back in July 2021 with her TestDDLCMod.

# CREDITS
Kizby - Assets related patches, and her efforts in preventing bundles from being unloaded. <br>
